Intructions:
============

1. Fork this repo on GitHub. 
2. Create a program that can interactively play the game of Tic-Tac-Toe against
   a human player and never lose.
3. Commit early and often, with good messages. 
4. Push your code back to GitHub and send me a pull request.

We are a Django shop, but it is not a requirement that you implement your
program as a Django app.

(Don't be offended when I don't actually pull. I will clone your repo and
inspect it locally when I receive the request. This repo will be left
solution-less for obvious reasons.)

Response:
=========

Thanks for the opportunity to participate in this challenge. It's been a
blast. I've implemented a little djanog web-app with most of the UI
functionality implemented in javascript and jquery and the back-end done in
django, with json over ajax to communicate between.

Setting Up:
-----------
